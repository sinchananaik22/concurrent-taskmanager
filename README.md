# concurrent-taskmanager

A concurrent task manager project in Go aims to efficiently handle multiple tasks concurrently using goroutines and channels. The goal is to create a system where tasks can be added dynamically, and a pool of workers processes these tasks concurrently. This project typically involves creating a task manager struct responsible for managing the tasks and worker goroutines.
